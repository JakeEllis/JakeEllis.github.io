                                    Hello welcome to my website.(ARTIST biography ???) I was born and raised in Lexington, KY. I never left. 
                                    I learned the trade starting at a young age along with private lessons from well-established local artists. 
                                    I earned an Associate in Arts degree from Bluegrass Community and Technical College (BCTC) and have receivied 
                                    my Bachelor of Arts degree in Graphic Design from Kentucky Wesleyan College (KWC) in December 2022. I made the Dean’s list at BCTC and KWC. 
                                    I look at things, places, events, and eben films and I say to myself I can do better, or this is the way that I would do or handle that situation. 
                                    I’ve worked with an art mentor, a well-known artist in Kentucky, for five years to improve my drawing skills. I like to draw what interests me and I
                                    want my work to look professional and real. I learn the best by one-on-one instruction. My landscape drawing of America is one of my significant, prized works
                                    and possessions and was displayed at the central library in Lexington. I like to think of myself as both an artist and writer. When I do artwork, I like it to 
                                    have meaning or story behind it, emphasizing specific concepts. What is the work communicating. I plan on continuing to do my artwork and writing my own stories. 
                                    I like to do everything myself. I plan to excel at writing since I am a creative thinker and enjoy being innovative.
