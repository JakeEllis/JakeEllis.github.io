  My name is Jacob Ellis, although most people call me Jake. I am a University of Louisville Alumni with my bachelors degree in Computer Information Systems and concentrations in Web Development and Information Security. I have experience on both the business and IT side as I have worked as a Developer, QA Analyst, Product Owner, and Business Analyst. Through the University of Louisville I learned the coding best practices of SQL, .NET (C#), HTML, CSS, Javascript, Unix, and Linux. Similarly, I learned and practiced Agile, Scrum, and Waterfall methodologies from both the IT and the Business sides. Through work I am able to practice what I have learned as well as learn new techologies such as Qlikview, Windows Communication Foundation Services (WCF), Oracle, Dollar Universe Scheduling, and even Mainframe.

  Outside of work, I enjoy to travel and be outside. I grew up playing sports year round and that has continued into my adult life. I love to rock climb and hike, as well as play basketball, golf, and run. As of March 10th, 2016 I have been traveling the United States with my girlfriend while she takes on travel nursing assignements. I am working remotely from home (wherever that might be) as a Business Consultant for Humana Inc. Working from home has been a challenge although its has provided us with the opportunity to grow as people while staying financially stable. Traveling has allowed us to experience life from different cultures and still feed our adventurous nature by hiking and climbing in new (and sometimes iconic) areas.
