  My name is Jacob Ellis, although most people call me Jake. I am a University of Louisville Alumni with my bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems and concentrations in Web Development and Information Security. I have experience on both the business and IT sides as I have worked as a Developer, QA Analyst, Product Owner, Business Analyst, and Business Consultant. Through the University of Louisville I learned the coding best practices of SQL, .NET (C#), HTML, CSS, Javascript, Unix, and Linux. Similarly, I learned and practiced Agile, Scrum, and Waterfall methodologies from both the IT and the Business perspective. Through work I am able to practice what I have learned as well as learn new technologies such as Qlikview, Windows Communication Foundation Services (WCF), Oracle, Dollar Universe Scheduling, and even Mainframe.

  Outside of work, I enjoy to travel and be outside especially rock climbing and hiking with my wife. On March 10th, 2016 my wife and I began traveling the United States while she worked as a travel nurse. I worked remotely from home as a Business Consultant for Humana Inc. We traveled for approximately 18 months and lived in Phoenix, Arizona (March, 2016 - June, 2016), Colorado Springs, Colorado (July, 2016 - October 2016), Denver, Colorado  (October, 2016 - January, 2017), Idaho Falls, Idaho (February, 2017 - May, 2017) and Portland Oregon (May, 2017 - September, 2017). We have since moved back to Kentucky where I am still working from home for Humana Inc.

   Working from home has been a learning experience, although its has provided me with the opportunity to grow while staying financially stable. I have learned that to succeed I must have determination and perseverance so that I am able to stay true to my obligations. On the other hand, Traveling has allowed us to experience life through different cultures and still feed our adventurous nature by hiking and climbing in new (and sometimes iconic) areas.
