  My name is Jacob Ellis, although most people call me Jake. I am a University of Louisville Alumni with my bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems and concentrations in Web Development and Information Security. I have experience on both the business and IT sides as I have worked as a Developer, QA Analyst, Product Owner, and Business Analyst. Through the University of Louisville I learned the coding best practices of SQL, .NET (C#), HTML, CSS, Javascript, Unix, and Linux. Similarly, I learned and practiced Agile, Scrum, and Waterfall methodologies from both the IT and the Business perspective. Through work I am able to practice what I have learned as well as learn new technologies such as Qlikview, Windows Communication Foundation Services (WCF), Oracle, Dollar Universe Scheduling, and even Mainframe.

  Outside of work, I enjoy to travel and be outside. I grew up playing sports year round and that has continued into my adult life. I love to rock climb and hike, as well as play basketball, golf, and run. As of March 10th, 2016 I have been traveling the United States with my girlfriend while she takes on travel nursing assignments. I am working remotely from home (wherever that might be) as a Business Consultant for Humana Inc. Right now (July, 2016 - today) we are located in Colorado Springs, Colorado after moving from Phoenix, Arizona (March, 2026 - June, 2016). Working from home has been a learning experience, although its has provided me with the opportunity to grow while staying financially stable. I have learned that to succeed I must have determination and perseverance so that I am able to stay true to my obligations. On the other hand, Traveling has allowed us to experience life through different cultures and still feed our adventurous nature by hiking and climbing in new (and sometimes iconic) areas.
