Welcome to my website! 
</p>

<p>
  I built this website in 2016, not only, as an online Resume, but because I wanted to spend my free time doing something that I enjoy rather than mindlessly scrolling through social media or watching TV. I had built a personal site when I was in college, although I was very new to web development so it was extremely basic and never fully finished. Since then, I have worked with Evan Neises to built a website, <a href="www.officetoadventure.com">"Office To Adventure"</a>, and by doing so I have gained much more experience.
