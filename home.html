Welcome to my website! 
</p>

<p>
This website was built completely from scratch while only using some helpful reminders from www.W3schools.com. I wanted to build this website for multiple reasons:
<ul>
  <li>Because I had built a very basic personal website in college and I know I can do better this time.</li>
  <li>To prove to myself that I could create a creative and functional website from scratch.</li> 
  <li>To build an online portfolio of all that I have done in the realm of Information Technology</li>
  <li>So that I didn't forget all of the web development skills I've learned in school and work.</li>
  <li>Because it is nice to work on something for yourself every now and then.</li>
  <li>So friends, family, recruiters, and employers can easily find information about me.</li>
  <li>So I have something productive to do rather than mindlessly scrolling through social media.</li>
</ul>
